# My KeePass
A KeePass password manager plugin for [BitBar](https://github.com/matryer/bitbar) that I created to have the passwords easily accessible from the menu bar.

## Features
- List of entries showing, title, user, password, url, and notes.
- Add new entry
- Delete entry
- Show/hide passwords
- Copy user, password, url, and notes to the clipboard.
- Open url direct on the browser.
- Settings: choose database (.kdbx) and enter password.
- Error handling

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pip3
- Module: pykeepass

## Installation
- Copy the script to your BitBar folder.
- Make sure it's executable (in Terminal, do `chmod +x plugin.sh`)
- Install dependencies (in Terminal, do `pip3 install pykeepass`)
- Then choose `Refresh all` from the BitBar menus
