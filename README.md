# My KeePass
It's a KeePass password manager plugin for [Bitbar](https://github.com/matryer/bitbar) that I created to have the passwords easily accessible from the menu bar.

## Features
- List of entries showing, title, user, password, url, and notes.
- Add new entry
- Delete entry
- Show/hide passwords
- Copy user, password, url, and notes to the clipboard.
- Open url direct on the browser.
- Settings: choose database (.kdbx) and enter password.
- Error handling
